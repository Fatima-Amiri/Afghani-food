<p>Afghan pulao, known as Qabili Pulao or Kabuli Pulao, is a ceremonial mixed rice dish suitable for gatherings, widely popular among the people of Afghanistan, and rooted in the city of Kabul. Qabili Pulao is also a traditional festive rice dish in Uzbekistan and is commonly prepared in the northern cities of Khorasan in Iranâ€”especially on Yalda Nightâ€”as a warming winter meal and for the Nowruz (Persian New Year) celebration. The method of preparing Uzbek and Afghan Qabili Pulao appears similar to Iranian-style 'Chelo Goosht' and 'Gheymeh Nesar of Qazvin', although it uses different spices. As a beloved dish made with red meat, the preparation and techniques of Afghan Qabili or Kabuli Pulaoâ€”considered one of the most popular rice dishes in Khorasanâ€”will be explored in this culinary guide.</p>
